Will it spawn left or will it spawn right? That's now for you to decide!

This mod adds a two new items, both called Spirit Overrider. When used, they will force the Hallow to spawn on one specific side of the world after defeating the Wall of Flesh. The side is determined by the item used!
For obvious reasons, they can only be crafted before hardmode.
